# Pair Programming Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Brief

This repository hosts the code for a simple Pokemon app built using the beta GraphQL endpoint of the open access [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/). There is a test console for testing GraphQL queries for the Pokemon API [here](https://beta.pokeapi.co/graphql/console/).

It displays a list of Pokemon from the series which, when you click on an entry, brings up some stats and information about that Pokemon.

We would like to make some improvements to this app

- There is a bug causing an error in the javascript console on the main entry list page. Please fix it.
- The stats bar on the detail page is always coloured green, regardless of the value. We would like to change this dynamically based on the stat value.
- On the list page, you can go to the next page, but once you do, you can never go back to the previous page. We would like this functionality added.
- When I visit the URL for Jigglypuff directly it shows a 'Pokemon not found' error, but when I go to it via the list (I need to click 'Next Page' once), then it works. Why not? Can you fix it?
